# QuantConnect Stubs Generator

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jmerle/quantconnect-stubs-generator/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jmerle/quantconnect-stubs-generator/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

**I am in the process of rewriting this project. The master branch is currently unstable. Not all features listed below are implemented yet.**

QuantConnect Stubs Generator is a program which generates Python stubs based on [QuantConnect/Lean](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean)'s C# codebase.

I initially created this project when I noticed QuantConnect started on this effort themselves, after which I got intrigued and wanted to try it for myself. The first version worked fine, but had quite a bulky codebase and no tests. In the second and current version the goal is to solve these problems. Although this version is a ground-up rewrite, much of the code from the first version is reused.

## Comparison with the official stubs

TBD: Add a comparison between the stubs generated by this generator and the stubs generated by [QuantConnect/ironpython-stubs](https://github.com/QuantConnect/ironpython-stubs).

## Installation

TBD: Add installation instructions.

## Development

To run the generator locally, clone the repository, `cd` into the QuantConnectStubsGenerator project and run `dotnet run <Lean directory> <output directory>`.

To run the unit tests, run `dotnet test`. To run the integration tests read [`integration/README.md`](./integration/README.md).
